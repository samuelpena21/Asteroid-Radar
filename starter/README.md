# To Setup this project

You need to get a NASA API KEY and add it into your local.properties file located in the root of the starter folder. 
If you don't have one, is very easy to get it. Just go to https://api.nasa.gov/  and follow the steps to generate the API key. When you have the key, just add the key 'NASA_API_KEY' with the generated API key value, and you are good to go!

This folder should contain the scaffolded project files to get a student started on their project. This repo will be added to the Classroom for students to use, so please do not have any solutions in this folder.
